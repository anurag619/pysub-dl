pysub-dl
========

Movie subtitle downloader

Actually now it only supports subscene.com to download the subtitles.

I know there is many work to do. It is first release so you can understand.

Installation
------------

Nothing is needed now. Only one dependency is there like BeautifulSoup, but don't worry it's a standalone script.

It will automatically download the dependency if not present. Still i haven't made any setup.py so I the installation of dependency also merged in this script so I called it 'standalone script'. Btw, Hang tight, will update it soon.

So, you manually don't have to install anything.

How to use
----------

Use it like: pysub-dl [moviename] [language]

$ pysub-dl iron-man english

$ pysun-dl hitman english

One request: Do not use space in the movie name, Use '-' instead of ' '
